# Forking vs. building from scratch

## Forking

### Advantages

- Lower development burden
- Sooner initial release

### Disadvantages

- We need to understand the entirety of someone else's codebase
- We do not have much of a say in the initial design

##  Building from scratch

### Advantages

- Total control
- High understanding, since we built everything ourselves

### Disadvantages

- High development burden
